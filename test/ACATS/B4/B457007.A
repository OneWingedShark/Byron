--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18010 and any applicable ACAA procedures.
--*
--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that if the type of a conditional expression is not determined by
--     the resolution rules, it is illegal.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--     In order for this to happen, the context must be one that allows
--     the type to be one of a class of types (else 4.5.7(13/3) would apply),
--     but not a type conversion (else 4.5.7(10/3) would apply).
--     Additionally, the expressions must be of different types (else
--     4.5.7(11/3) would apply), and none of the types can be universal
--     (else 4.5.7(12/3) would apply).
--
--     We try a number of such contexts.
--
--     We didn't try the expression of a "delay until", as the only interesting
--     case (that is, one that doesn't fail Legality Rules) using
--     language-defined types would have required using Ada.Calendar and
--     Ada.Real_Time, the latter being an Annex package which we can't use in
--     core tests like this one. The test would have looked something like:
--         delay until (if Accurate then Ada.Real_Time.Clock + 10.0
--                                  else Ada.Calendar.Clock + 10.0);
--
--     We didn't try many cases that require static expressions. These
--     require using two typed constants of different types in order to cause
--     a problem; possible but not likely as most such expressions are likely
--     to be of a universal type. We did try one such case just to touch the
--     possibility. Some untested such contexts include:
--        The expressions of an enumeration reprrsentation clause;
--        The expressions of a real_range_specification;
--        The expressions of a signed_integer_range_specification.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      30 Nov 2015   RLB     Created test.
--       1 Dec 2015   RLB     Fixed incorrect declarations.
