--
--    The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--    Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--    with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--    assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--    to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--    ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.

--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--    Check that legality rules for record component associations are
--    enforced for an extension aggregate. Specifically:
--      (A) The selector names can only name components and discriminants
--          of the record extension, and cannot name components of
--          other variants or of the type of the ancestor part;
--      (B) A component association (other than others => <>) is illegal
--          if it does not have an associated component;
--      (C) The aggregate is illegal if it has needed components that are
--          not associated with any component associations;
--      (D) The aggregate is illegal if it has a needed component that is
--          associated with more than one component association;
--      (E) A component association with an expression cannot have two or
--          more associated components of different types.
--
--    This test may appear to belong to 4.3.2 (which defines extension
--    aggregates), but the rules being tested are for record component
--    associations, and those are given in 4.3.1. Thus the test is
--    named as part of 4.3.1.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--    26 Apr 2007   RLB   Created test from outline of existing ACATS test.
