--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with

--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that if the selecting expression of a case expression is a
--     name with a static nominal subtype that has a static predicate, then
--     no discrete_choice can cover any value that does not satisfy its
--     predicates.
--
--     Check that if the selecting expression of a case expression is a
--     name with a static nominal subtype that has a static predicate, and
--     there is no others choice, then every value that satisfies the
--     predicates of the subtype must be covered by some discrete_choice.
--
--     Check that a case expression choice is illegal if it is a subtype
--     with a dynamic predicate.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--     In addition to testing the objectives above, we also check that
--     a choice naming a subtype only covers the values that satisfy the
--     predicates of the subtype (3.8.1(10.1/4)).
--
--     We try examples of each kind of discrete type. Note that we do not
--     try generic formal types here, as the predicates are not visible
--     in the generic unit, and the rules are not rechecked in the instance.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      23 May 14   RLB     Created test from case statement version.
