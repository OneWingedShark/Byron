--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that if the subtype indication of an uninitialized allocator
--      specifies an access type, no explicit constraint is permitted.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      The test checks that an explicit index or discriminant constraint is
--      illegal in the subtype indication of an uninitialized allocator if the
--      subtype mark is that of an access type.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      05 Apr 96   SAIC    Prerelease version for ACVC 2.1.
--      03 Aug 96   SAIC    Removed constraint from
--                          Single_Indirect_Access_Person. Added
--                          initialization and parameter cases.
