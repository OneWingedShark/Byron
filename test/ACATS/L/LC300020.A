--                                     Notice
--
--    The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--    Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--    with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--    assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--    to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--    ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.

--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that recursive instantiation is not allowed. (This is rule
--      12.3(19)). Case 2 - Two levels.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      Declare a generic procedure (LC30002_0), then a generic package
--      with an instantiation of the procedure (LC30002_1). Complete the
--      cycle by instantiating the generic package in the body of the
--      procedure. Declare a main subprogram that includes an instantiation
--      of the generic procedure. An attempt to execute this partition must
--      fail.
--
-- SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
--      To build this test:
--         1) Compile the file LC300020 (and include the results in the
--            program library).
--         2) Compile the file LC300021 (and include the results in the
--            program library).
--         3) Compile the file LC300022 (and include the results in the
--            program library).
--         4) Attempt to build an executable image.
--         5) If an executable image results, run it.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> LC300020.A
--         LC300021.A
--         LC300022.AM
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      The test passes if a link time error message reports that
--      LC200022 contains a recursive instantiation, or the
--      compilation of LC300021 or LC300022 is rejected because it contains
--      a recursive instantiation.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--     20 Jul 2002   RLB    Initial test, created from BC3009C.
