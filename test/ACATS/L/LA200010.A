--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that two units or subunits with the same expanded name cannot
--      be included in the same partition. Check that a partition can be
--      created even if the environment contains two units with the same
--      name. (This is rule 10.2(19)).
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      Declare the a parent package (LA20001_0). Declare a child package
--      (LA20001_0.LA20001_1). Declare a subunit in the parent package body
--      (LA20001_1). Declare a main subprogram that includes the child.
--      An attempt to create this partition must fail.
--
-- SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
--      To build this test:
--         1) Compile the file LA200010 (and include the results in the
--            program library).
--         2) Compile the file LA200011 (and include the results in the
--            program library).
--         3) Compile the file LA200012 (and include the results in the
--            program library).
--         4) Attempt to build an executable image.
--         5) If an executable image results, run it.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> LA200010.A
--         LA200011.A
--         LA200012.AM
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      The test passes if a link time error message reports that
--      LA200012 violates 10.2(19), or the compilation of LA200012 is rejected
--      because it must violate 10.2(19).
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--     25 Jan 99   RLB     Initial test, removed from B830001.
--     27 JAN 99   RLB     Revised for reviewer comments.
