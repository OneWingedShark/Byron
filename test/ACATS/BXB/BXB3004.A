--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.

--  OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that the aspect Unchecked_Union cannot be specified illegally:
--       (A) It cannot be specified on a non-record type;
--       (B) It cannot be specified on a record type that does not
--           have discriminants;
--       (C) It cannot be specified on a record type that have discriminants
--           but does not have a variant part;
--       (D) It cannot be specified for a derived record type whose parent
--           type is a discriminated record type with a variant part that
--           has primitive operations;
--       (E) Its expression cannot have a type other than Boolean;
--       (F) Its expression cannot be a non-static Boolean expression.
--
--  TEST DESCRIPTION:
--     This checks B.3.3(3.1-3.2/3). [(D) tests 13.1(10), which is triggered
--     by the "representation aspect" wording.] We try various cases to try
--     all of the errors above.
--
--     B.3.3(7/2) requires that all components of an unchecked union have
--     nominal subtypes that are C-compatible. To ensure this, we use types
--     from Interfaces.C; we also could have usedtypes with explicit
--     convention C. Other types could be C-compatible if the "implementation
--     permits it" (B.1(20)), but that is not suitable for an ACATS test.
--
--  APPLICABILITY CRITERIA:
--     This test is applicable to implementations that support package
--     Interfaces.C and aspect Unchecked_Union.
--
--  CHANGE HISTORY:
--     22 APR 2015  RLB  Created test.
