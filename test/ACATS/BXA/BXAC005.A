--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that Text_IO.File_Type objects cannot be used in conjunction
--         with stream-oriented attributes 'Write and 'Read.
--      Check that Streams.Stream_IO.File_Type objects cannot be used in
--         Text_IO file data transfer operations.
--      Check that stream access objects cannot be used as file object
--         parameters of Text_IO.Put and Text_IO.Get procedures.
--      Check that Put and Get are not defined as type attributes for use 
--         with stream files.
--      Check that the package Stream_Support, which was originally defined
--         in the 9X Mapping Specification and Ada 9X ILS, but which has been 
--         changed to package Streams in AARM;3.0, is not included in the
--         compilation system predefined library. 
--         (Note: This portion of the objective can be deleted in the future.)
--      
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      This test is designed to ensure that compiler systems identify a
--      number of potentially typical user errors that could occur when
--      using Stream_IO capabilities.
--      This test uses statements that assure that Text_IO.File_Type objects 
--      cannot be used in conjunction with stream-oriented attributes 'Write 
--      and 'Read; statements that Streams.Stream_IO.File_Type objects cannot 
--      be used in Text_IO file data transfer operations; statements
--      that assure stream access values cannot be used as file object 
--      parameters of Text_IO.Put and Text_IO.Get procedures; and statements 
--      that assure that Put and Get are not defined as type attributes for 
--      use with stream files.
