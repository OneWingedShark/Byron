--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.
--*
--  OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that "reverse" cannot be used in a generalized iterator if the type
--     of the iterator_name is not a reversible iterator type.
--
--     Check that "reverse" cannot be used in a container element iterator if
--     the default iterator type of the type of the iterable_name is not a
--     reversible iterator type.
--
--  CHANGE HISTORY:
--     08 Oct 2013 BM  Initial Version.
--     31 May 2014 RLB ACATS 4.0 version: renamed foundation and test packages.
