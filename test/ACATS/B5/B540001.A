--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.

--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that if the selecting expression of a case statement is a
--     name with a static nominal subtype that has a static predicate, then
--     no discrete_choice can cover any value that does not satisfy its
--     predicates.
--
--     Check that if the selecting expression of a case statement is a
--     name with a static nominal subtype that has a static predicate, and
--     there is no others choice, then every value that satisfies the
--     predicates of the subtype must be covered by some discrete_choice.
--
--     Check that a case statement choice is illegal if it is a subtype
--     with a dynamic predicate.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--     In addition to testing the objectives above, we also check that
--     a choice naming a subtype only covers the values that satisfy the
--     predicates of the subtype (3.8.1(10.1/4)).
--
--     We try examples of each kind of discrete type. Note that we do not
--     try generic formal types here, as the predicates are not visible
--     in the generic unit, and the rules are not rechecked in the instance.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      14 Jan 12   RAD     Initial version.
--      23 May 14   RLB     Split case statement test into separate
--                          test; added extra test cases.
