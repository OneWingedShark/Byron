--*
--
-- OBJECTIVE
--     Check the requirements of the modified 8.3(26) from Technical
--     Corrigendum 1 (originally discussed as AI95-00150).
--     For a type extension declared in a child package, where the parent
--     type is declared in an ancestor package, it is illegal for the two
--     types to have duplicate component names.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION
--     We declare lots of types with illegal duplicate component names.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> B8300020.A
--         B8300021.A
--         B8300022.A
--         B8300023.A
--         B8300024.A
--         B8300025.AM
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      Files B8300021.A, B8300022.A, B8300023.A, and B8300024.A contain errors.
--	All errors in these files must be detected to pass the test.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      29 JUN 1999   RAD   Initial Version
--      23 SEP 1999   RLB   Revised to insure that units don't depend on other
--                          units containing errors.
--      24 SEP 1999   RLB   Removed broken test case.
