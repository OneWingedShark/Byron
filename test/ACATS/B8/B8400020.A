--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.

-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that the name in a use package clause cannot denote the limited
--     view of a package.
--
--     Check that the name in a use package clause cannot denote a generic
--     package.
--
--     Check that the name in a use package clause cannot denote a type or
--     object.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--
--     We test the objectives directly. For the entities allowed in a context
--     clause, we test that as well as in a package specification. For the
--     the third objective, we also try protected types. Note that forgetting
--     "type" in a use type clause is a fairly common error, so we want to
--     ensure that it is detected. The legacy test B84001A tries "use" on
--     subprograms and task types, so we don't do that here.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> B8400020.A
--         B8400021.A
--         B8400022.A
--         B8400023.A
--         B8400024.A
--         B8400025.A
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      Each of files B8400021.A, B8400022.A, B8400023.A, B8400024.A,
--      and B8400025 contains errors. All errors in all these
--      files must be detected to pass the test; no errors should be
--      detected in file B8400020.A.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      15 Apr 2015   RLB   Created test, patterned after test BA12017.
