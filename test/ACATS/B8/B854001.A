-- OBJECTIVE:
--    Check that a renaming-as-body is illegal if the declaration occurs before
--    the subprogram it completes is frozen, and the renaming renames the
--    subprogram itself.  (Defect Report 8652/0027, as reflected in Technical
--    Corrigendum 1).

-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--    29 JAN 2001   PHL   Initial version.
