-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that, for P'Access of an access-to-subprogram type S, the
--      accessibility level of the subprogram denoted by P must not be
--      statically deeper than that of S. Check for cases where P'Access
--      occurs in the visible and private part of an instance.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      In order to satisfy accessibility requirements, the designated
--      subprogram P must be at the same or a less deep nesting level than the
--      access-to-subprogram type S -- P must "live" as long as S. Nesting
--      levels are the run-time nestings of masters: block statements;
--      subprogram, task, and entry bodies; and accept statements. Packages
--      are invisible to accessibility rules.
--
--      This test declares two generic packages in which P is declared in
--      the instance itself: one in which P'Access occurs in the visible
--      part, and one in which P'Access occurs in the private part.  In both 
--      cases the type S of P'Access is also passed as an actual parameter,
--      and the accessibility level of P is that of the instance.
--
--      The test declares access-to-subprogram types in various packages and 
--      subprogram bodies. These types are passed as actuals to instantiations, 
--      which are attempted at various nesting levels. The test verifies that 
--      P'Access is illegal when P is declared at a nesting level deeper than 
--      that of the type of P'Access, and legal otherwise.
--
--      The nesting structure is as follows:
--
--          - Library-level package         (Level = 0)
--         |
--          - end package
--
--          - Main subprogram               (Level = 1)
--         |
--         |     *** testing here
--         |
--         |    - Nested procedure          (Level = 2)
--         |   |     *** testing here
--         |   |  begin
--         |    - end procedure
--         |
--         |  begin
--          - end main subprogram
