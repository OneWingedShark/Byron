--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that for derived types with known discriminant parts the
--      parent subtype must be constrained; if the parent type is not
--      tagged, each discriminant of the new type must be used in the
--      constraint defining the parent subtype; and, if a discriminant is
--      used in the constraint defining the parent subtype, the subtype of
--      that discriminant must be statically compatible with the subtype
--      of the corresponding parent discriminant.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      Declares several discriminated record types, attempts to derive
--      from them violating the rules for deriving from discriminated
--      types.  This test attempts to make all the violations that typify
--      user errors.
