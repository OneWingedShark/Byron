--*
--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that:
--      A discriminant on a tagged type is not allowed to have a
--      default.
--      Private record extension is not allowed to be declared
--      immediately within a subprogram declarative region.
--      Record extension of a nonlimited type does not allow limited
--      components.
--      Record extension does not allow repeating identifiers used in
--      the parent declaration.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      This test declares a tagged type and attempts to extend it in
--      four illegal ways as described in the objective.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      06 Dec 94   SAIC    ACVC 2.0
--      15 Nov 95   SAIC    Restructured for 2.0.1
--      15 Mar 07   RLB     Removed tests of nested extensions, as those
--                          are allowed by the Amendment.
