--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that if a (non-derived) tagged type has any limited components,
--      the reserved word limited must appear in its definition. Check for
--      basic and generic cases.
--
--      Check that if the parent type of a record extension is nonlimited,
--      each of the components of the record extension part must be nonlimited.
--      Check for generic declarations and instances.
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      For (non-derived) tagged types:
--
--         Basic cases:
--
--         Declare nonlimited tagged types with components of limited types.
--         Include cases where the component type becomes nonlimited. Verify
--         that the declared types are illegal.
--
--         Generic cases:
--
--         Declare nonlimited tagged types with components of formal private
--         and formal derived types. Include cases where the ancestor type of
--         the formal derived type is also a formal type. Verify that the
--         declared types are illegal if the component types are limited.
--
--
--      For record extensions:
--
--         Generic declarations:
--
--         Derive types with limited components from formal tagged private
--         types and formal private extensions. Include cases where the
--         component type is also a formal type. Verify that the derived types
--         are illegal if the parent type is not limited.
--
--         Derive types with components of formal private types and formal
--         derived types from nonlimited parent types. Include cases
--         where the parent type is a formal tagged private type or formal
--         private extension. Verify that the derived types are illegal if
--         the component types are limited.
--
--         Generic instances:
--
--         Derive types with limited components from limited formal tagged
--         private types. Include cases where the component type is a limited
--         formal private type or formal derived type. Verify that the
--         (nonformal) derived types are illegal if the actual corresponding
--         to the parent type is not limited (except when the component type
--         is a formal type whose corresponding actual is also not limited).
