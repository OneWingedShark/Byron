--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that, for X'Access of a general access type A, if the designated
--      type is tagged, the type of the view denoted by X must be covered by
--      the designated type. Check that if the designated type is not tagged,
--      the type of the view must be the same, and either A's designated
--      subtype must statically match the nominal subtype of the view, or the
--      designated subtype must be discriminated and unconstrained.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      For tagged designated types:
--
--         A specific tagged type covers only itself. A class-wide type covers
--         all the types in its class. 
--
--         Declare the following type hierarchy:
--
--                                    T
--                            New_T_1   New_T_2
--                                              NNew_T_2
--
--         Declare a general access type with designated type New_T_2, and
--         attempt to assign X'Access to an object of this type. Verify that
--         X'Access is legal if X is of type New_T_2, but illegal if X is of 
--         type T, NNew_T_2, or New_T_2'Class.
--
--         Declare a general access type with designated type New_T_2'Class,
--         and attempt to assign X'Access to an object of this type. Verify
--         that X'Access is legal if X is of type New_T_2, NNew_T_2, or 
--         NNew_T_2'Class, but illegal if X is of type T, New_T_1, or T'Class.
--
--         Test cases where X is a formal subprogram parameter or a stand-alone
--         object. Include discriminated types within the hierarchy.
--
--
--      For non-tagged designated types:
--
--         Declare a discriminated record type with defaulted discriminants
--         and various constrained and unconstrained subtypes. Declare general
--         access types designating the various subtypes, and attempt to
--         assign X'Access to objects of these types. Verify that X'Access
--         is legal if the designated subtype statically matches the nominal
--         subtype of X or if the designated subtype is discriminated and
--         unconstrained, and is illegal otherwise. Include a case where X is
--         constrained implicitly by its initial value, such that its actual
--         subtype statically matches the designated subtype, but its nominal
--         subtype does not.
--
--         Declare various constrained and unconstrained subtypes of the
--         unconstrained array type String, as well as a type derived from
--         String. Declare general access types designating the various
--         subtypes, and attempt to assign X'Access to objects of these types.
--         Verify that X'Access is legal if the designated type statically
--         matches the nominal subtype of X, and is illegal otherwise.
--         Include a case where X is constrained implicitly by its initial
--         value, such that its actual subtype statically matches the
--         designated subtype, but its nominal subtype does not.
