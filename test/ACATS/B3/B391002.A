--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that a type extension may not be declared in a generic body if
--      the parent type is a descendant of a formal type declared in the
--      formal part of the generic unit.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      Type extensions are attempted within a generic body with various
--      parent types: record and type extensions; type declared within
--      other library packages, within the corresponding generic specification,
--      within a formal package; formal types of both the formal package
--      and the generic itself.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      06 Dec 94   SAIC    ACVC 2.0
--      23 Mar 07   RLB     Updated to reflect new wording of 3.9.1(4/2).
