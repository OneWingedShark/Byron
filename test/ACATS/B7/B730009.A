--                                     Notice
--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.
--*
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that a tagged partial view can be synchronized if and only if
--      the completion is a synchronized type.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      We declare a variety of synchronized interfaces, and private extensions
--      from those interfaces, then make sure that completions are
--      either task types or protected types. Note that we try to avoid cases
--      where the declaration would be illegal for other reasons.
--
--      It is legal to declare a non-synchronized private extension of a
--      synchronized interface, but no completion can be legal (synchronized
--      interfaces can only be used in task, protected, interface, and private
--      extension declarations). In this case, we allow the error to reported
--      on either the private extension or on the completion.
--
--      This test is checking 7.3(7.2/2).
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--     The test contains several lines marked POSSIBLE ERROR: [Setnn].
--     For each value of n, the implementation must detect one or more of
--     these possible errors. For instance, an error must be detected on
--     at least one of the lines labeled POSSIBLE ERROR: [Set1] for an
--     implementation to pass.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      30 Dec 13   RLB     Created from similar test B730008.
--      23 Jan 15   RLB     Completion of Priv12 violated 7.3(10.1/3),
--                          added limited to repair that.
