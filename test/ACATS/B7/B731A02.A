-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that the inherited primitive subprograms of a derived type are
--      implicitly declared at the earliest place within the immediate scope
--      of the type declaration (but after the type declaration) where the
--      corresponding declaration from the parent is visible.  Check that, 
--      within its scope, the full view determines which components are visible.
--
--      Check for the cases where the parent is a partial view (tagged private
--      type) declared in a package, and the derived type is declared in:
--
--         - the visible part of a private child unit
--         - a package nested within the visible part of a private child unit
--         - a non-child package, and is further derived from in a child unit
--         - a package nested within the visible part of a public child unit
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      A tagged private type is declared in the visible part of a package,
--      along with operations on the type. The full view of the tagged
--      private type is declared in the private part, along with additional
--      operations on the type.
--
--      The inherited primitive subprograms of a type derived from the tagged
--      private type will include the operations declared in both the visible
--      and private parts. However, the subprograms declared in the private
--      part are only available within the declarative region of the package
--      (which includes its child units).
--
--      The operations and components of the derived type become available at
--      the first place within the immediate scope of the derived type where
--      the corresponding operations and components of the parent type become
--      visible. For a type derived in a private child unit of the package
--      declaring the parent type, they become available in the visible part.
--      For a package nested within the visible part of a private child unit,
--      they also become available in the visible part. For a package nested
--      within the visible part of a public child unit, they become available
--      in the body of the nested unit.
--
--      If the derived type is declared in a package which is not a descendant
--      of the package declaring the parent type, only the operations on the
--      parent declared in the visible part are implicitly declared for the
--      derived type. If the derived type is in turn the parent of a type
--      derived in a child unit of the package declaring the parent type, the
--      private operations are not available for the new derived type.
--
--      The availability of the components of the full view of the parent type
--      is analogous to that of operations.
