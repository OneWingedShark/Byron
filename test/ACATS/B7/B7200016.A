--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that if a library package declaration or library 
--      generic package declaration does not require a body, that 
--      a body is not allowed.  Check that pragma Elaborate_Body 
--      can be used to require a body even if not otherwise required.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      This test declares a number of library packages and then
--      checks that only those package bodies that are legal are
--      accepted.  The test cases were derived from instances
--      in ACVC legacy tests that were not legal under Ada 95 and
--      required changing.  From these tests, individual cases were
--      identified and reproduced as part of this test.  Further,
--      instances were derived from RM 6.0.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--         B7200010.A
--         B7200011.A
--         B7200012.A
--         B7200013.A
--         B7200014.A
--         B7200015.A
--      -> B7200016.A
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--     15 FEB 95   SAIC    Initial version
--     19 NOV 96   SAIC    Corrected spelling.
--     08 DEC 96   SAIC    Split test into multiple files. Corrected
--                         prologue. Corrected placement of pragma in
--                         B720001_6.
