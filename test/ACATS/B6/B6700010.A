--                                     Notice
--
--    The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--    Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--    with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--    assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--    to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--    ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.

--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--    Check that a completion is not allowed for a null_procedure_declaration.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--    The test declares various null procedures, and then tries to complete
--    them with various kinds of completion: a procedure body,
--    a renames-as-body, a procedure stub, and an instance of a generic
--    procedure. A pragma Import is also a completion, but B.1(22)
--    says that an Import may serve as a completion "notwithstanding any
--    rule to the contrary". Thus it (could be) legal to complete a
--    null procedure with a pragma Import.
--
--    The test also checks that the presence of a null procedure in a
--    package specification does not require the existence of a body.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> B6700010.A
--         B6700011.AM
--         B6700012.A
--         B6700013.A
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--    19 Aug 2004   PHL   Initial version.
--    03 May 2007   RLB   Added test cases for additional kinds of completion.
--    18 Aug 2007   RLB   Corrected unit name.
