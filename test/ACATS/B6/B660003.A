-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that the modes of the parameters of an operator cannot have a
--     mode other than IN.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--       2 Feb 81   DAS     Created legacy test B65001A.
--      10 Mar 14   RLB     Created test from legacy test B65001A, now
--                          obsolete because functions (but not operators) can
--                          have parameters of other modes. Added enumeration
--                          and instance subtests.
