<H1>6.1.1 Workflow using the Grading Tool</H1>
<div class="Normal">The workflow using the Grading Tool is similar to 
using the ACATS manually. The steps needed are outlined below.</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term">1.</div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
Install and configure the ACATS in the normal way, as outlined in clauses 
<A HREF="UG-51.HTM">5.1</A>, <A HREF="UG-52.HTM">5.2</A>, and <A HREF="UG-53.HTM">5.3</A>. 
It is particular important that Macro Defs customization <A HREF="UG-522.HTM">5.2.2</A> 
is accomplished <I>before</I> generating any test summaries, as the summary 
program is unaware of the macro syntax. Also, do not use the grading 
tool on the support tests in the CZ directory, as some of these include 
intentional failure messages that the grading tool is not prepared to 
handle.</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term">2.</div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
Compile the Grading and Test Summary Tools, as described in <A HREF="UG-613.HTM">6.1.3</A>.</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term">3.</div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
Determine how Event Traces are going to be constructed. If the implementation 
provides direct writing of an event trace (as described in <A HREF="UG-622.HTM">6.2.2</A>), 
then go to step 4a. Otherwise, acquire or create a listing convertion 
tool as described in <A HREF="UG-623.HTM">6.2.3</A>, and go to step 4b.</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term">4a.</div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
Create command scripts (as described in <A HREF="UG-54.HTM">5.4</A>) 
to process the ACATS. Include in those the appropriate option to create 
event traces. Also, modify Report.A so that the constant Generate_Event_Trace_File 
has the value True. When complete, go to step 5.</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term"></div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
The command scripts could generate one giant event trace for the entire 
ACATS, but it probably is more manageable to create several smaller event 
traces for portions of the ACATS. One obvious way to do that is to create 
a single event trace for each subdirectory that contains ACATS tests 
in its default delivery structure. (Such event traces can be combined 
later, if desired.)</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term">4b.</div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
Create command scripts (as described in <A HREF="UG-54.HTM">5.4</A>) 
to process the ACATS. Include in those use of the listing conversion 
tool to make event traces. Then go to step 5.</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term">5.</div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
Create test summaries for each grading segment. If, for instance, you 
will grade each directory individually, then you will need a test summary 
file for each directory. These files can be generated by running the 
Test Summary tool on each source file in the directory using a single 
summary file as output. On most operating systems, this is easily accomplished 
with a script command. (Some possibilities are discussed in <A HREF="UG-615.HTM">6.1.5</A>).</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term"></div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
The Test Summary Files will only need to be regenerated if the ACATS 
tests change in some way (typically, when an ACATS Modification List 
is issued). It's probably easiest to make a script to regenerate the 
entire set of summaries so that it can be used when the suite changes. 
Once the entire set of test summaries has been created, move to step 
6.</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term">6.</div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
Create an empty manual grading request file. This is just an empty text 
file. (See <A HREF="UG-64.HTM">6.4</A> for more information.)</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term">7.</div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
Process the ACATS tests, creating event traces. The event traces should 
contain the same tests as the test summary files. This process is described 
in <A HREF="UG-55.HTM">5.5</A>.</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term">8.</div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
Run the Grading Tool (GRADE) on the pairs of event traces and summaries, 
using the current manual grading request file. Typically, the default 
options are sufficient, but some implementations or event traces may 
need options. The options are described in <A HREF="UG-614.HTM">6.1.4</A>.</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term">9.</div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
If all of the grading reports display Passed, you're done. But most likely, 
some tests will be reported as failed. The grading tool will report the 
first failure reason for each test, but there may be additional failure 
reasons for each test.</div>
<div class="Indented4NarrowHanging-Term">A.</div><div class="Indented4NarrowHanging-Body">
If the failure reason is a process failure or a missing compilation, 
most likely there is a problem with the scripts that process the ACATS. 
Make sure that the test files are compiled in the appropriate order and 
no test files are missing. A missing compilation might also mean that 
the test needs to be split. See item B.</div>
<div class="Indented4NarrowHanging-Term">B.</div><div class="Indented4NarrowHanging-Body">
If the failure reason is extra or missing errors, grade the test manually 
(see <A HREF="UG-56.HTM">5.6</A>) to see if the problem is with the implementation 
or the Grading Tool being too strict about error locations. If manual 
grading indicates the test passed, add the test to your Manual Grading 
Request file - again, see <A HREF="UG-64.HTM">6.4</A> (preferably with 
a comment explaining why it was added). Note that it is not necessary 
to remove tests from this list: if the grading tool determines that the 
test grades as Passed or Not Applicable, it will not request manual grading 
for the test even if it appears in this list.</div>
<div class="Indented4NarrowHanging-Term"></div><div class="Indented4NarrowHanging-Body">
If the manual grading indicates that the test needs to be split, do the 
following. First, add the test to your Manual Grading Request file - 
the ACATS requires processing the original test in this case. (Be sure 
to put in a comment that the test is split, since it won't be necessary 
to manually grade the original test in that case.) Then, split the test 
following the guidelines in <A HREF="UG-525.HTM">5.2.5</A>, and add the 
split tests to a processing script and the test summary script. The Test 
Summary tool can create summaries for split tests, so the grading tool 
can be used to grade them.</div>
<div class="Indented4NarrowHanging-Term">C.</div><div class="Indented4NarrowHanging-Body">
For other failure reasons, most likely the implementation is at fault. 
Fixing the implementation is likely the only way to meaningfully change 
the result. In the unlikely event that there is a problem with a test, 
the procedure for test challenges are outlined in <A HREF="UG-572.HTM">5.7.2</A>. 
</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term"></div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
You'll also need to handle any special handling tests, including any 
tests that require manual grading. (This is one good reason to keep the 
manual grading list as short as possible.)</div>
<div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Term"></div><div class="Indented2NarrowHanging-Body">
Then return to step 7 and repeat the test run.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Normal">Using this procedure, the vast majority of tests 
will not require hand grading. Future ACATS updates may improve tests 
that are particulary difficult to grade automatically. <SPAN STYLE="color: rgb(153,0,0)">The 
ACAA is interested in which tests need manual grading for your implementation 
- see <A HREF="UG-64.HTM">6.4</A>.</SPAN></div>
