<H1>5.6.2 Expected Results for Class B Tests</H1>
<div class="Normal">Class B tests are expected to be compiled but are 
not subject to further processing and are not intended to be executable. 
An implementation must correctly report each clearly marked error (the 
notation <TT>-- ERROR:</TT> occurs at the right hand side of the source). 
A multiple unit B test file generally will have errors only in one compilation 
unit per source file. Error messages must provide some means of specifying 
the location of an error, but they are not required to be in direct proximity 
with the <TT>-- ERROR:</TT> marking of the errors. The actual text of 
error messages is not used in determining whether an error is properly 
detected; only the location of the reported error is used. (The ACATS 
must not prevent innovation in error handling.)</div>
<div class="Normal">Some B-tests also include the notation <TT>-- OK</TT> 
to indicate constructs that <I>must not</I> be identified as errors. 
Such constructs are typically similar to illegal constructs and serve 
to ensure that implementations do not reject too much. Not identifying 
<TT>-- OK</TT> constructs as errors is especially important since some 
constructs that were errors in <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada83">[Ada83]</A> 
are now legal in later versions of Ada.</div>
<div class="Normal">Some B-tests exercise constructs whose correctness 
depends on source code that is textually separated (for example, a deferred 
constant and its full declaration). In these cases, it may be reasonable 
to report an error at both locations. Such cases are marked with <TT>-- 
OPTIONAL ERROR</TT>. These lines may be flagged as errors by some, but 
not all, implementations. Unless an optional error is marked as an error 
for the wrong reason, an error report (or lack of it) does not affect 
the pass/fail status of the test.</div>
<div class="Normal">Some B-tests contain constructs where it would be 
reasonable for a compiler to report an error at one of several source 
locations. When it would not be appropriate for the ACATS to insist on 
a particular source location, all such source locations are marked with 
<TT>-- POSSIBLE ERROR:</TT> and an indication of which error set (if 
the test contains several) the location belongs to. In such cases, an 
implementation is considered to have properly reported the error if it 
reports an error at any of the places marked <TT>-- POSSIBLE ERROR:</TT> 
for a particular set. The implementation may flag more than one such 
place; this does not affect the pass/fail status of the test. However, 
the test is graded &quot;failed&quot; if no error is reported at any 
of the places marked <TT>-- POSSIBLE ERROR:</TT> for an error set.</div>
<div class="Normal">A test is graded as &quot;passed&quot; if it reports 
each error in the test. The content of error messages is considered only 
to determine that they are indeed indications of errors (as opposed to 
warnings) and that they refer to the expected errors. The Reference Manual 
does not specify the form or content of error messages. In particular, 
a test with just one expected error is graded as &quot;passed&quot; if 
the test is rejected at compile time for any reason.</div>
<div class="Normal">A test is graded as &quot;failed&quot; if it fails 
to report on each error in the test or if it marks legal code as incorrect.</div>
