<H1>1.2 ACATS Coverage of Ada</H1>
<div class="Normal">The ACATS needs to test as many Ada language rules 
as possible in order to meet the goal of enhancing Ada software portability. 
After all, a rule that is not tested is far more likely to be incorrectly 
implemented than one that is tested.</div>
<div class="Normal">Therefore the ACATS strives for complete coverage 
of the standard. <I>Complete coverage</I><A NAME="I1015"></A> means that 
every rule in the Ada standard has one or more associated tests that 
ensure that the rule is implemented properly.</div>
<div class="Normal">Complete coverage is especially important for legality 
rules and runtime checks. It is easy for implementers to miss these rules, 
as their compiler may do something useful in the absence of the checks. 
But allowing such incorrect code can be a major portability problem when 
a program is moved to a compiler (including a later version of the same 
compiler) that properly implements the rules and checks.</div>
<div class="Normal">Of course, complete coverage does not mean that every 
sentence in the Ada standard has an associated test. There are many lines 
in the standard that are not rules at all, such as notes and examples. 
There are also many lines in the standard that are not testable; documentation 
requirements are but one example. There are also rules in the standard 
which could be tested, but such tests would be outside of the purpose 
of the ACATS. Rules which express options for Ada implementations (such 
as permissions or advice) are in this category (as the ACATS does not 
test implementation quality).</div>
<div class="Normal">It should be obvious that the importance of testing 
particular rules in the Ada standard vary widely. In part, that's because 
the various Ada features themselves have widely varying importance. (For 
example, looking at three features that ACATS 4.1 could have tested, 
proper operation of if expressions is more important than correct functioning 
of record equality, which in turn is more important than run-time accessibility 
checks for coextensions.) But it's also because of the differing nature 
of the rules. For instance, testing of syntax rules is not very important 
in most cases, as correct syntax will be checked by tests for other rules, 
and tests for incorrect syntax require guessing what error a compiler 
might make in interpreting syntax. Unless an error seems particularly 
likely (as might happen from some irregularity in the syntax), such guessing 
is unlikely to find actual errors. This makes it impossible for there 
to be a definitive set of rules that need to be tested to accomplish 
complete coverage, as the decision as to whether a particular rule is 
usefully testable can be a judgement call.</div>
<div class="Normal">In any case, complete coverage is a goal for the 
ACATS. However, it is not expected to be ever be achieved. As the ACATS 
gets nearer to the goal, the value of additional tests will drop (since 
higher value tests get created earlier), and at some point, the cost 
of creating and processing new tests would outweigh their value.</div>
<div class="Normal">Since exactly which rules need to be tested to accomplish 
complete coverage will always be a judgement call, the test coverage 
analysis of the ACATS is a set of living documents, which will be updated 
with new information and tests with each new ACATS version.</div>
<div class="Normal">Coverage testing will generally not test combinations 
of features, so problems that only manifest themselves in such combinations 
will not be detected. Tests designed primarily to cover language rules 
are most useful to prevent gross errors in implementations (such as forgetting 
to implement checks or features). As such, the ACATS also supplements 
those tests with tests written to emulate the patterns of use of Ada 
features. Such tests provide tests of common combinations of features, 
and ensure that common idioms are implemented properly.</div>
<div class="Normal">A detailed description of how coverage is determined 
for the Ada standard can be found in Section <A HREF="UG-32.HTM">3.2</A>.</div>
