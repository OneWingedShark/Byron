<H1>3.2.2 General Coverage Guidelines</H1>
<div class="Normal">As noted in Section <A HREF="UG-12.HTM">1.2</A>, 
the ACATS strives for complete coverage of the Ada standard. However, 
complete coverage does not mean that every sentence in the standard has 
an associated test objective and test. Not all rules are testable; one 
important way to determine testability of a rule is to check its category. 
The next clause (<A HREF="UG-323.HTM">3.2.3</A>) will discuss how the 
category of a rule affects its mapping to test objectives.</div>
<div class="Normal">There are also additional considerations that don't 
apply to specific rule categories.</div>
<div class="Normal">Text sometimes contains definitions (especially in 
Static Semantics rules). Definitions are hard to handle, because they 
usually are not testable by themselves. The definition has to be used 
in another rule to make them visible. For instance, a categorization 
rule such as &quot;something is either this, that, or fuzzy&quot; cannot 
be tested by itself. &quot;Something&quot; has to be used in some other 
rule in order for the categorization to matter. That being the case, 
it usually makes sense to test the definition as part of the other rule(s). 
Such rules are marked as having a kind of &quot;Widely Used&quot; or 
&quot;Subpart&quot; in the coverage documentation. &quot;Subpart&quot; 
rules are tested as part of specific other objectives, while &quot;Widely 
Used&quot; rules are thought to be tested by many tests indirectly (and 
no attempt is made to verify that). In some cases, especially those that 
otherwise would have a combinatorial explosion, it may make more sense 
to test the definition as directly as possible (in which case objectives 
will be assigned to the definition).</div>
<div class="Normal">Text sometimes includes sentences marked as redundant 
by the AARM. Such sentences should be given normatively elsewhere, and 
the testing should be done in the place where they are normatively given. 
The AARM often will indicate this place.</div>
<div class="Normal">Combinational explosion is always a problem for visibility 
rules. Rules that define the scope or visibility of something should 
always be tested in place (even though other rules will need to be used 
to accomplish that).</div>
