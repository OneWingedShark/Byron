<H1>3.2.1 Coverage Documents</H1>
<div class="Normal">ACVC 2.0 originated coverage documentation for what 
is now the ACATS. That coverage document mapped tests to paragraph numbers 
in the <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada95">[Ada95]</A> Standard. Over time, a number 
of deficiencies in that approach have been identified:&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Where a paragraph contains multiple rules, it is 
not possible to tell if all of the rules are tested. Indeed, a number 
of instances where important rules were untested have been identified.</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Since there is not an indication of the type of 
rule represented by a paragraph, it is not obvious whether the rule is 
appropriately tested. For instance, a Legality Rule tested only with 
C-Tests is not appropriately tested (see <A HREF="UG-323.HTM">3.2.3</A> 
for more on this topic).</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Rules not modified in <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada95">[Ada95]</A> 
were not considered. However, sometimes additional test objectives are 
needed for existing rules because of other changes to the language. Moreover, 
there is no determination of whether the legacy tests adequately tested 
the original rule.</div>
<div class="Bulleted">The plaintext coverage document is not easily processed 
by tools. In particular, paragraphs that are covered are indicated only 
by the test name(s) that cover the paragraph; there is no common string 
for a tool to count. As such, it is difficult to get metrics about coverage 
from the document, and in particular to quantify progress between versions. 
</div>
<div class="Normal">For these reasons, the development of new and much 
more detailed coverage documentation was initiated for ACATS 3.0. The 
new documentation considers each sentence of the standard individually 
if necessary, listing the test objectives for each sentence, and documenting 
why no objectives are needed if none are provided.</div>
<div class="Normal">It also lists tests for each objective (including 
Legacy tests), testing priorities for untested objectives, notes on each 
objective (including any untested cases), and any additional notes needed.</div>
<div class="Normal">There is also a summary document that summarizes 
totals for important metrics for the coverage documents as a whole.</div>
<div class="Normal">The documents are maintained as spreadsheets (in 
order to make calculation and extraction of metrics easy). Because spreadsheet 
programs may be unfamilar to many readers, and compatibility of spreadsheet 
programs is incomplete, these documents are provided in Adobe Portable 
Document Format (PDF). (The spreadsheets are available on request from 
the ACAA Technical Agent, <A HREF="mailto:agent@ada-auth.org">agent@ada-auth.org</A>.)</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">For ACATS 4.1, the 
following subclauses of the Ada Standard documents are included in the 
new coverage documents:&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Examples">3.2.4<BR>
3.9.3&nbsp;through&nbsp;3.10.1<BR>
4.1.3&nbsp;through&nbsp;4.4<BR>
4.5.7&nbsp;through&nbsp;4.5.8<BR>
5.4&nbsp;through&nbsp;5.5.2<BR>
6.1.1<BR>
6.5&nbsp;through&nbsp;6.8<BR>
7.3.2&nbsp;through&nbsp;7.6.1<BR>
8.3.1&nbsp;through&nbsp;8.5.3<BR>
Clause&nbsp;10&nbsp;(10&nbsp;through&nbsp;10.2.1)<BR>
13.1.1<BR>
B.3.3</div>
<div class="Normal">These clauses were selected because of their importance 
in rule changes in either <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada2012">[Ada2012]</A> or 
<A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Amend1">[Amend1]</A>.</div>
<div class="Normal">The original coverage document is also included with 
the ACATS for those portions of the Ada Standard documents that have 
not yet had new coverage documents constructed. This document is of primary 
use for features of <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada95">[Ada95]</A>, as it does 
not cover Legacy tests nor any features added or modified by either <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada2012">[Ada2012]</A> 
or <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Amend1">[Amend1]</A>. As noted above, it is being 
replaced, so it will disappear completely in a future version of the 
ACATS.</div>
