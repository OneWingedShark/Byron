<H1>Section 1: Introduction</H1>
<div class="Normal">The Ada Conformity Assessment Test Suite (ACATS) 
provides the official tests used to check conformity of an Ada implementation 
with the Ada programming language standard (<A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada2012">ANSI/ISO/IEC 
8652:2012</A> and later corrigenda, including <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#TC1-2012">ANSI/ISO/IEC 
8652:2012/COR 1:2016</A>). The ACATS User's Guide is part of the ACATS 
and is distributed with the test programs and testing support packages. 
It explains the contents and use of the test suite.<A NAME="I1001"></A><A NAME="I1002"></A><A NAME="I1003"></A><A NAME="I1004"></A><A NAME="I1005"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">The ACATS is an important part of the conformity 
assessment process described in ISO/IEC-18009, Ada: Conformity of a Language 
Processor <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#ISO99">[ISO99]</A>. This standard provides 
a framework for testing language processors, providing a stable and reproducible 
basis for testing. The Ada Resource Association (ARA) has sponsored an 
instantiation of that process since October 1998. The process is managed 
by the Ada Conformity Assessment Authority (ACAA).<A NAME="I1006"></A><A NAME="I1007"></A><A NAME="I1008"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">Prior to the ISO standard, the U.S. Department of 
Defense sponsored a similar conformity assessment process under the Ada 
Joint Program Office (AJPO). The test suite for that process was known 
as the Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC).<A NAME="I1009"></A><A NAME="I1010"></A><A NAME="I1011"></A> 
The AJPO developed ACVC versions based on <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada83">ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A-1983, 
ISO/8652:1987</A> (Ada 83), which were numbered 1.x where x ranged from 
1 to 11. It later developed ACVC versions based on ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1995 
(<A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada95">[Ada95]</A>), numbered 2.0, 2.0.1, 2.1, and 
2.2.</div>
<div class="Normal">When the ACAA took over Ada conformity assessment, 
it adopted the ACVC as the basis for its test suite. The ACAA determined 
to continue to use the same version numbering for the test suite in order 
to avoid confusion. The version of the ACVC current at the time (2.1) 
was initially used as ACATS 2.1. Later, the already developed but unreleased 
ACVC 2.2 was released and used as ACATS 2.2. The ACAA later released 
ACATS 2.3, ACATS 2.4, ACATS 2.5, and then ACATS 2.6 to include maintenance 
changes and a few new tests.</div>
<div class="Normal">In 2007, the ACAA developed ACATS version 3.0 to 
check for conformity to new language features defined in ISO/IEC 8652:1995/AMD 
1:2007 (<A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Amend1">[Amend1]</A>), as well as test programs 
to check for conformity to language features defined in earlier versions 
of Ada, including <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada95">[Ada95]</A> and <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada83">[Ada83]</A>. 
The ACAA later released ACATS 3.1 to improve the coverage and correctness 
of the ACATS for features defined in <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Amend1">[Amend1]</A>.</div>
<div class="Normal">In 2014, the ACAA developed ACATS version 4.0 to 
test the enhancements and changes of the third edition of the Ada Standard, 
ISO/IEC 8652:2012 (<A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada2012">[Ada2012]</A>). This version 
of the ACATS, version 4.1, was released to improve the coverage and correctness 
of the ACATS for features defined in <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada2012">[Ada2012]</A>, 
including features originally defined in earlier versions of the Ada 
Standard. Subsequent maintenance or enhancement versions of the suite, 
if they are required, will be numbered 4.2, etc.</div>
<div class="Normal">The ACATS User's Guide describes the set of ACATS 
tests and how they are to be used in preparation for conformity assessment. 
The formal procedures for conformity assessment are described in <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Pro31">[Pro31]</A>, 
and the rules in that document govern all conformity assessments, notwithstanding 
anything in this document that may be interpreted differently. Moreover, 
this guide does not discuss specific requirements on processing of the 
ACATS test suite, or submission and grading of results that an Ada Conformity 
Assessment Laboratory (ACAL) may impose.<A NAME="I1012"></A><A NAME="I1013"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">The User's Guide is intended to be used by compiler 
implementers, software developers who maintain a version of the ACATS 
as a quality control or software acceptance tool, and third-party testers 
(e.g., Ada Conformity Assessment Laboratories).</div>
<div class="Normal">Section <A HREF="UG-2.HTM">2</A> of the User's Guide 
for ACATS 4.1 summarizes the changes between ACATS 4.0 and ACATS 4.1. 
Section <A HREF="UG-3.HTM">3</A> describes test objectives and their 
relationship to ACATS tests and to the rules of the Ada Standards documents. 
Section <A HREF="UG-4.HTM">4</A> describes the configuration of the ACATS, 
including a description of the ACATS software and delivery files. Section 
<A HREF="UG-5.HTM">5</A> provides step-by-step instructions for installing 
and using the test programs and test support packages, and for grading 
test results. The appendices include other information that characterizes 
the ACATS 4.1 release, along with information on test construction.</div>
<div class="Normal">Refer to <A HREF="UG-F.HTM">Annex F</A> and Section 
<A HREF="UG-56.HTM">5.6</A> for the definition of an acceptable result 
and the rules for grading ACATS 4.1 test program results. Section <A HREF="UG-572.HTM">5.7.2</A> 
provides instructions for submitting a petition against a test program 
if a user believes that a deviation from the acceptable results for a 
given test program is in fact conforming behavior.</div>
<div class="Normal">The ACATS test suite is available from any ACAL and 
from the ACAA web site. See <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/acats.html">http://www.ada-auth.org/acats.html</A>.</div>
