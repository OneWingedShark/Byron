--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.
--*
-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that violations of the legality rules for aspect specifications
--     are detected.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--
--     This test checks the global rules for aspect specifications given
--     in 13.1.1 - it does not check requirements for specific aspects.
--     Note that the language sometimes overrides the 13.1.1 rules for
--     specific aspects -- these do not apply to evey possible aspect,
--     but do apply to most.
--
--     We check that each of the following requirements on an aspect
--     specification are enforced:
--       (A) An aspect_declaration is illegal if any usage name resolves
--           differently at the first freezing point of the associated
--           entity and at the end of the immediately enclosing declaration
--           list; 13.1.1(13/3)
--       (B) The Aspect_Mark must identify an aspect of the associated entity;
--           13.1.1(14/3)
--       (C) Multiple occurrences of an aspect are not allowed in a single
--           aspect specification; 13.1.1(14/3)
--       (D) The aspect_definition cannot be omitted for a non-boolean aspect;
--           13.1.1(15/3)
--       (E) An aspect cannot include 'Class unless it applies to a tagged type
--           or primitive subprogram of a tagged type; 13.1.1(16/3)
--       (F) No language-defined aspects can be specified on a
--           renaming_declaration or a generic_formal_parameter_declaration;
--           13.1.1(17/3)
--       (G) A language-defined aspect cannot be specified on the completion
--           of a subprogram; 13.1.1(18/3).
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--     11 Jan 12   SWB     Initial pre-release version.
--     30 Jan 12   SWB     Restructured test to have main subprogram.
--     25 Apr 14   RLB     Changes to issue in ACATS 4.0; reorganized test
--                         cases and added several additional test cases.
