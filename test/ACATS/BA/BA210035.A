-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that all compilation units of a preelaborated library unit
--      must depend semantically only on compilation units of other
--      preelaborated library units.
--
--      Check that all compilation units of a declared-pure library unit
--      must depend semantically only on compilation units of other library
--      units which are declared pure.
--
--      Check that a preelaborated unit may have a non-preelaborable child
--      unit, but not a non-preelaborable subunit.
