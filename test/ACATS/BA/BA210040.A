--
-- OBJECTIVE
--     Check the requirements of the modified RM-10.2.1(11) from Technical
--     Corrigendum 1 (originally discussed as AI95-00002).
--     This change does not negate the requirement of RM-10.2.1(11),
--     which requires that all semantic dependents of a preelaborated
--     library unit also be preelaborated (whether or not they are used
--     during elaboration).
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION
--     Declare several library units (including subprograms) with pragma
--     Preelaborate, and make them illegally depend on non-preelaborated
--     library units.  Depend via with clauses and parent/child dependence.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      29 JUN 1999   RAD   Initial Version
--      23 SEP 1999   RLB   Revised to separate units with errors from correct
--                          units.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> BA210040.A
--         BA210041.A
--         BA210042.A
--         BA210043.A
--         BA210044.A
--         BA210045.AM
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      Files BA210041.A, BA210042.A, BA210043.A, and BA210044.A contain errors.
--	All errors in these files must be detected to pass the test.
