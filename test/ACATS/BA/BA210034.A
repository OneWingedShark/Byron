-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that all compilation units of a preelaborated library unit
--      must depend semantically only on compilation units of other
--      preelaborated library units.
--
--      Check that all compilation units of a declared-pure library unit
--      must depend semantically only on compilation units of other library
--      units which are declared pure.
--
--      Check that a preelaborated unit may have a non-preelaborable child
--      unit, but not a non-preelaborable subunit.

--          | (but pragma PURE would  |                ||

--                                         =========================
--
--      Verify that a compilation unit (in this case, the body) of a declared-
--      pure package (BA21003_4) may not WITH a preelaborated package
--      (BA21003_3), even if the preelaborated package declares no variables
--      or named access types, and thus could have been declared pure.
--
