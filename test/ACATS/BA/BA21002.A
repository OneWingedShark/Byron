--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that each of the following constructs is illegal within the body
--      of a library package to which a pragma Pure applies:
--
--         (a) A statement other than a null statement.
--         (b) A primary that is a name of an object, if the name is
--             not a static expression and does not statically denote a
--             discriminant of an enclosing type.
--         (c) A declaration of an object that is initialized by default
--             of a type that does not have preelaborable initialization.
--         (d) A declaration of a variable, with or without an initialization
--             expression, outside of a subprogram, generic subprogram, task
--             unit, or protected unit.
--         (e) A declaration of a named access-to-object type whose
--             Storage_Size is not zero outside of a subprogram, generic
--             subprogram, task unit, or protected unit.
--         (f) An extension aggregate with an ancestor subtype mark denoting
--             a subtype of a private extension.
--         (g) A declaration of a (constant) object which causes the
--             evaluation of a default expression that will call a
--             user-defined function.
--
--
--      Check that each of the following constructs is legal within the body of
--      a library package to which a pragma Pure applies:
--
--         (h) A call to a static function.
--         (i) A primary that is a name of an object, if the name is a static
--             expression.
--         (j) A declaration of a constant object outside of a subprogram,
--             generic subprogram, task unit, or protected unit.
--         (k) A declaration of a (constant) object which would cause the
--             evaluation of a default expression that will call a
--             user-defined function, except that the component with the
--             default expression is explicitly initialized.
--         (l) A declaration of a variable, with or without an initialization
--             expression, inside a subprogram.
--         (m) A declaration of a named access type inside a subprogram.
--         (n) A declaration of an anonymous access type.
--         (o) A declaration of a constant object of a descendant of a private
--             type (within the scope of the full view).
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      Declare various supporting types, objects, and subprograms in a
--      preelaborated package declaration. Verify the legality of the
--      constructs (h)-(o) above in the corresponding package body. Verify
--      the illegality of the constructs (a)-(g) above in both the visible
--      and private part of a preelaborated package declaration which names
--      the first package in a with clause.
--

-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      05 Apr 95   SAIC    Initial prerelease version.
--      22 Mar 07   RLB     Updated objective for Amendment 1 changes.
