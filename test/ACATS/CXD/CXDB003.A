--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that if a task becomes Held while waiting in a selective
--      accept and an entry call is issued to one of the open entries, the
--      corresponding accept body executes.  Check that once the rendezvous 
--      completes the task does not execute until another Continue.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION: 
--      Target_Task is a task with a selective accept.  The test driver 
--      starts Target_Task and allows it to proceed to the Select.   It
--      then Holds Target_Task and, when held, calls an entry in the Select.
--      Once the driver has proved that code outside the rendezvous has
--      not been executed and that the rendezvous itself has completed
--      it Continues Target_Task and, by calling another entry in the 
--      select proves that Target_Task is functioning properly.
--      This test will hang if the first rendezvous is not completed or
--      if Target_Task is not properly Continued.
--
-- APPLICABILITY CRITERIA:  
--      This test is only applicable to implementations supporting:
--         the Real-Time Annex and 
--         the package Asynchronous_Task_Control.
-- 
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      06 Dec 94   SAIC    ACVC 2.0
--      09 Nov 95   SAIC    ACVC 2.0.1 - added applicability criteria
