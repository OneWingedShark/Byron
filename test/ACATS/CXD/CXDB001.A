--
-- OBJECTIVE: 
--      Check that, in Ada.Asynchronous_Task_Control, the Hold operation 
--      reduces the priority of the target task to such a state that it does
--      not  run and that Continue raises it such that it will run again. 
--      Check that  Is_Held returns true if, and only if, the target task is
--      in the Held state. Check that Tasking_Error is raised if any of these
--      operations is applied to a task that is terminated.  
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION: 
--      Two tasks are involved in this test.  Target_Task computes  in a
--      shared protected object.  Driver Holds Target_Task then Continues it,
--      verifying that Target_Task is actually halted or proceeding by
--      checking the state of Target_Task's on-going computation.  It also
--      verifies that Is_Held returns the expected state.  Driver then allows
--      Target_Task to terminate and checks that calls to
--      Ada.Asynchronous_Task_Control referring Target_Task raise
--      Tasking_Error.
--
-- APPLICABILITY CRITERIA:  
--      This test is only applicable to implementations supporting:
--         the Real-Time Annex and 
--         the package Asynchronous_Task_Control.
-- 
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      06 Dec 94   SAIC    ACVC 2.0
--      09 Nov 95   SAIC    Added applicability criteria for ACVC 2.0.1
