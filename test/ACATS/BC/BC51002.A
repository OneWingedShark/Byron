--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that if a generic formal derived subtype is definite, the
--      actual subtype must not be indefinite. Check in cases where the formal
--      subtype appears in contexts where an indefinite subtype would be
--      legal.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      A definite subtype is any subtype which is not indefinite. An
--      indefinite subtype is either:
--         a) An unconstrained array subtype.
--         b) A subtype with unknown discriminants (this includes class-wide
--            types).
--         c) A subtype with unconstrained discriminants without defaults.
--
--      For this test, we must have a definite generic formal derived type
--      such that it makes sense to attempt to pass it an indefinite actual.
--      (Note that the formal derived type may not have an unknown discriminant
--      part, nor may it have a known discriminant part, since defaults may
--      not be specified for the discriminants.) 
--
--      The ancestor type of the formal derived type must therefore be either
--      a constrained array subtype, a discriminated type with defaults, or a
--      tagged type (since defaults are not allowed for discriminants of
--      tagged types, the ancestor type may not be a discriminated tagged
--      type). If the ancestor type for a tagged formal derived type has no
--      discriminants, it is unlikely that a programmer would define a type
--      with an unknown discriminant part (e.g., a private extension or a
--      formal derived type) using that ancestor type. That leaves the
--      following cases of interest:
--
--            Formal derived ancestor               Actual
--            ------------------------------------  ------
--         1) Constrained array subtype             Unconstrained type of
--                                                  the subtype                
--         2) Constrained record subtype            Unconstrained type (no
--                                                  defaults) of the subtype
--         3) Unconstrained record type w/defaults  Formal derived with same
--                                                  ancestor but unknown disc.
--         4) Tagged type                           Class-wide type of ancestor
