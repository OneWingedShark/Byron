--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that, for a formal private type with a known discriminant part,
--      the subtype of each discriminant of the actual type must statically
--      match the subtype of the corresponding discriminant of the formal type.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      Two subtypes of the same type statically match if their constraints
--      statically match. Two constraints statically match if they are both
--      null constraints, both are static and have equal corresponding bounds
--      or discriminant values, or both are nonstatic and result from the same
--      elaboration of a constraint of a subtype indication or the same
--      evaluation of a range of a discrete subtype definition.
--
--      This test checks cases where the discriminant subtypes are discrete,
--      and their constraints are static.

--      06 Dec 94   SAIC    ACVC 2.0
--      13 Nov 95   SAIC    ACVC 2.0.1 fixes: Changed status of last case
--                          from OK to ERROR.
