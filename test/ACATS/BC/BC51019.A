--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that a generic formal derived tagged type is a private extension.
--      Specifically, check that, for a generic formal derived type whose
--      ancestor type has a primitive subprogram which is a function with a
--      controlling result, the function must be overridden for non-abstract
--      record extensions of the formal derived type. Check that the function
--      need not be overridden for abstract record extensions, nor for private
--      extensions, although for non-abstract private extensions it must be
--      overridden for the corresponding full type.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      A record extension of the formal derived type inherits the subprograms
--      of the formal derived type, which correspond to those of the ancestor
--      type.
--
--      An inherited subprogram of an abstract (record or private)
--      extension that is a function with a controlling result is an abstract
--      subprogram. In addition, abstract subprograms are inherited as
--      abstract. Recall that type abstractness is never inherited; it
--      always must be specified with the type extension.
--
--      However, an inherited subprogram of a non-abstract record
--      extension that is a function with a controlling result is a
--      concrete subprogram that requires overriding. (Amendment 1
--      provides that such functions do not need to be overridden for
--      a null extension.) Inherited abstract subprograms also require
--      overriding.
--
--
--      Similarly, an inherited subprogram of a non-abstract private
--      extension that is a function with a controlling result is a
--      concrete subprogram, as are inherited abstract subprograms.
--      In this case, the full type is expected
--      to provide the subprogram, so there are no special checks
--      associated with the private extension itself.
--
--
--      This test checks that if a record extension of a formal derived type
--      inherits a subprogram that is a function with a controlling result,
--      the derived type must either be declared abstract, or the inherited
--      subprogram is overridden. It also checks that no inappropriate
--      restrictions are placed in private extensions. Cases are verified for
--      both abstract and non-abstract formal derived types. (Test BC51020
--      checks cases of inherited abstract subprograms.)
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      06 Dec 94   SAIC    ACVC 2.0.
--      22 Mar 07   RLB     Corrected test so that the functions require
--                          overriding as the test is expected; also
--                          corrected the terminology and test description.
