-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that a formal_abstract_subprogram_declaration cannot lack a
--     controlling type.
--
--     Check that a formal_abstract_subprogram_declaration cannot have
--     multiple controlling types.
--
--     Check that a formal_abstract_subprogram_declaration cannot have
--     a controlling type that is incomplete.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--     We try formal abstract subprograms whose controlling type is each
--     of the kinds of types allowed (mentioned in AARM 12.6(8.b/2)):
--     a formal tagged private type, a formal derived type, a formal
--     interface type, or a normal tagged type, as well as cases that
--     are similar (a formal untagged private type; a formal derived type
--     that is not tagged, and a normal untagged type).
--
--     We also try functions that only have a controlling result, as well
--     as routines with multiple controlling operands of the same type.
--
--     The test marks the errors (1), (2), or (3) depending on which of the
--     three objectives are involved.
--
--     The last objective is for Ada 2012; the rest are for the 2007 Amendment
--     to Ada 95.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--     18 May 2015   RLB   Created test.
