-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that, if the reserved word "abstract" does not appear in the
--      declaration of a formal derived type, the actual type must not be
--      an abstract type. Check that, if the ancestor type is abstract, and the
--      formal derived type is not, neither the ancestor type nor its abstract
--      descendants may be passed as actuals. Check that, if the formal derived
--      type is abstract, then the following entities that are of the formal
--      type are illegal: a component, an object created by an object
--      declaration or an allocator, a generic formal object of mode in, the
--      the result type of a non-abstract function.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      Verify that both specific abstract types and formal abstract types
--      are illegal as actuals in instantiations of generics declaring formal
--      non-abstract derived types. Include a case where the formal type of a
--      formal package is used as an actual. Verify that both basic and aliased
--      object declarations are illegal if the type is a formal abstract type.
--      Verify that components of a formal abstract type are illegal for both
--      records and arrays.
