-- OBJECTIVE
--    Check that a subprogram default of null shall not be specified for a
--    formal function.
--
--    Check that a subprogram default of null shall not be specified for a
--    formal abstract subprogram.
--
--    Check that a null procedure as a formal subprogram default has convention
--    Intrinsic.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION
--    This test checks the effect of rules introduced by AI95-00348-1, and
--    combined with AI95-0260-2.
--
-- HISTORY:
--      19 Aug 2004   PHL   Initial version.
--      18 Dec 2014   RLB   Created test from two submitted tests and some
--                          additional cases (for the second objective).
