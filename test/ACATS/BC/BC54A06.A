--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that, for a formal access-to-object type, the designated
--      subtypes of the formal and actual must statically match. Check for the
--      case where the access-to-object type is a pool-specific
--      access-to-variable type.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      Two subtypes of the same type statically match if their constraints
--      statically match. Two constraints statically match if they are both
--      null constraints, both are static and have equal corresponding bounds
--      or discriminant values, or both are nonstatic and result from the same
--      elaboration of a constraint of a subtype indication or the same
--      evaluation of a range of a discrete subtype definition.
--      The test declares generics with formal pool-specific access-to-variable
--      types designating tagged and formal discrete types.
--      For each of these designated types (as appropriate), various general
--      and pool-specific access-to-variable actual types are declared which
--      designate unconstrained, constrained, class-wide, and derived types,
--      with null, static, and nonstatic constraints.
