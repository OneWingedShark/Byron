--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that, for a formal access-to-object type, the designated
--      subtypes of the formal and actual must statically match. Check for the
--      case where the access-to-object type is a general access-to-constant
--      type.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      Two subtypes of the same type statically match if their constraints
--      statically match. Two constraints statically match if they are both
--      null constraints, both are static and have equal corresponding bounds
--      or discriminant values, or both are nonstatic and result from the same
--      elaboration of a constraint of a subtype indication or the same
--      evaluation of a range of a discrete subtype definition.
--      The test declares generics with formal access-to-constant types
--      designating discrete (integer) and array types. For each of these
--      designated types (as appropriate), various access-to-constant actual
--      types are declared which designate unconstrained, constrained,
--      class-wide, and derived types, with null, static, and nonstatic
--      constraints.
