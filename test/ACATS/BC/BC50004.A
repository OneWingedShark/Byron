--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that the actual corresponding to a formal ordinary fixed point
--      type may not be a decimal fixed point type.
--
--      Check that the actual corresponding to a formal decimal fixed point
--      type may not be a ordinary fixed point type.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      Declare formal ordinary and decimal fixed point types. Verify that the
--      actual type passed to each formal must be in the class of types
--      implied by the syntactic category of the formal type definition (e.g.,
--      the actual for a formal decimal fixed point type must be a decimal
--      fixed point type).
--
-- APPLICABILITY CRITERIA:
--      This test is only applicable to implementations which support smalls
--      that are powers of 10 (as is required by decimal fixed point types),
--      and to implementations which allow decimal fixed point type 
--      declarations.
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      For implementations which do not support smalls that are powers of
--      10, the declarations of types BC50004_0.Ordinary_Fixed and
--      BC50004_0.Decimal_Fixed must be flagged as illegal.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      01 Feb 95   SAIC    Initial version.
--      10 Apr 96   SAIC    Corrected digits value for BC50004_0.Decimal_Fixed.
